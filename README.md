To execute the real-time emotion detection system, follow these steps:

1) Open a command prompt.
2) Navigate to the "realtime-emotion-detection" folder using the command prompt.
3) Ensure that the required libraries are installed, including NumPy, Keras, OpenCV, and TensorFlow.
4) Execute the Python script named "real_time_video.py" by running the command python real_time_video.py.
5) Once the script is executed, the system will begin capturing video from the webcam and analyzing facial expressions in real-time.

Ensure that the webcam is properly connected and configured for the system to capture video input accurately.
